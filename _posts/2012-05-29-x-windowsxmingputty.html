<p>x is the protocal of image transition, it can transmit the view of program (x client) to the x server(the program for display and operation)</p>
<p>x client(program) &lt;-&gt; x server(display)</p>
<p>x system : xorg xfree86</p>
<p>If you have the x system, it is just display, can not manage the windows.</p>
<p>XDM is the window manager.</p>
<p>gnome kde xfce have more manager program with windows manager.</p>
<p>xfce is good one for this....</p>
<p>If you want install the x server on windows, your server is in unix/linux</p>
<p>1. using the sshd  X11 forward.... (then, all the program  to sshd client)</p>
<p>2. install the x server (xming) on windows</p>
<p>3. runing the graphic program on unix, it will display on your windows system</p>
<p>xfce and gnome are also graphic program ... so it can do this way...</p>
