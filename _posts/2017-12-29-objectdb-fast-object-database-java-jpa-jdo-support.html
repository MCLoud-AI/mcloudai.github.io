<p>Databases are the bottleneck in most database driven applications. Therefore, database performance is critical. ObjectDB is extremely fast, much faster than any other JPA solution.</p>
<p>Using a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and retrieve Java objects requires slow conversions between graphs of Java objects and flat database table rows. Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools can reduce some manual work but cannot eliminate the extra processing time, and even add their own overhead.</p>
<p>ObjectDB supports direct storage of graphs of objects and eliminates the ORM layer. The result is better performance and faster applications, especially when the object data model is complex.</p>
