<div class="post-text">
<p>From Wikipedia: DLNA</p>
<blockquote><p>DLNA uses Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) for media management, discovery and control.[4] UPnP defines the types of device that DLNA supports ("server", "renderer", "controller") and the mechanisms for accessing media over a network. The DLNA guidelines then apply a layer of restrictions over the types of media file format, encodings and resolutions that a device must support.</p></blockquote>
<p>From Wikipedia: UPnP</p>
<blockquote><p>Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of networking protocols that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and establish functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment. UPnP is intended primarily for residential networks without enterprise class devices.</p></blockquote>
<p>UPnP is a P2P protocol for LAN devcie.</p>
<p>DLNA is build on UPnP for Video, Photo and Music.</p>
