<p>You should think about wait and wait' in connection with ok and ok'.</p>
<p>Here is a suitable interpretation of their combinations:</p>
<p>ok /\ wait: the process is in a stable intermediate state of its<br />
sequential predecessor.</p>
<p>ok /\ not wait: the process has been properly started from a stable final<br />
state of its sequential predecessor.</p>
<p>not ok: the process is in an unstable state of its sequential predecessor.</p>
<p>ok' /\ wait': the process is in a stable intermediate state.</p>
<p>ok' /\ not wait': the process is in a stable final state.</p>
<p>not ok': the process is in an unstable state.</p>
<p>As you can see, although wait and ok are boolean variables, there are<br />
only three interesting combinations of their values (and the same for<br />
wait' and ok').</p>
