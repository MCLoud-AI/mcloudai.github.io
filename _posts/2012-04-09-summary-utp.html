<p>using the different formal method to describe different level of software enginerring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>three main method:</p>
<p>1.  denotational semantics -  denote everything as predicate.</p>
<p>no matter the specification, design, program.....</p>
<p>then you can use the predicate calculus to verify the character.</p>
<p>you can derive the algebraic law (equation or inequation)from the predicate.</p>
<p>In utp, it define the basic program unit using predicate.  and all of this are monotonic .</p>
<p>2.  algebraic semantics</p>
<p>providing equations and inequations for comparison, trans-formation a nd optimisation of designs and programs.</p>
<p>3.  operational semantics</p>
<p>describing individual steps of a possible mechanical implementation.</p>
<p>the mainly work is define the pattern transition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>at last, the three semantics must be consistency.</p>
<p>beside, the other extension must be interest:</p>
<p>timing, probability and parallel</p>
<p>1. parallel:</p>
<p>The op erational style was the Calculus of Communicating Systems(CCS)</p>
<p>the algebraic style Algebra of Concurrent Processes(ACP)</p>
<p>the denotational stylelies Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
