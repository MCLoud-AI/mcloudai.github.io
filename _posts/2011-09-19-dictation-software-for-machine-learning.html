<p>Today i look for the stanford machine learning video, but it has not the caption. so i make the caption by myself..</p>
<p>first i search some software but i fount the sofeware time machine is the best one . so i seek the mauual and video for it.</p>
<p>the summary is as follows:</p>
<p>1. get the sources of the video ..</p>
<p>720 or 350 p</p>
<p>720p -&gt; avi/mkv by the h.264/xvid</p>
<p>250p -&gt; rmvb/mp4 by the mpg 1 2 3</p>
<p>2. make the timeline</p>
<p>get every sentense start point and end point by using time machine.</p>
<p>3. dictation</p>
<p>4. translation</p>
<p>5.modify the timeline ///synchronism</p>
<p>using the function of the time meachine</p>
<p>6. first save as src.</p>
<p>7. add the author andÂ  annotion and save to ass..</p>
<p>8. transformal and compress to the finnal formal</p>
<p>but i found it is not good for the diction . so i found the other software named media study player(MSP). it can automate to build the timeline and easy to diction. and can save the content to the src formal , it will easy to modify by the time meachine and other caption maker program..</p>
<p>by the way the time machine is open sources softeware , writhen by the vs2008 within the mfc</p>
