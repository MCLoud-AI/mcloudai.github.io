<p>Last day, I download the "en_windows_8_enterprise_x64_dvd_917522.iso" to my computer. Today, I write some experience here.</p>
<p>1. Install</p>
<p>1.1 fail to load iso</p>
<p>there are some problem here. This is the iso file. so I want using my mobile disk to load it. But I remember the software "EasyBCD" can easy Grub to my computer. so I download it, but it does not work. so I load iso by my hand using:</p>
<p>map xxx.iso</p>
<p>but i can not load, beacause the file have fragments.  i remember i can load the iso which is not exceed my memory size. so I use the tools of defragments "wconfig" to defragement. but the tool is not working. prompt: it have no more space for it. so i delete some file. then it works.</p>
<p>1.2 fail to install beacause have no driver.</p>
<p>because this way to install, it can not load enough driver. so i extract it to folder. and then access to my rescue for command line to run setup.exe for  install. It works now</p>
<p>2. Configuration</p>
<p>2.1 adding account to windows 8</p>
<p>It can add hotmail and gmail for windows 8. then it can be automated syn from server.</p>
<p>2.2 activation</p>
<p>Now, the windows must be activation. there are two ways: KMS(180 days) slmgr.exe and MAK (permanent). but The KMS server is block. so it can only use MAK key to activate system.  using slui.exe 3 to open the activation windows. if you can not activate it online. you must cut off your network. then the option of activation by phone could appear. choose the location and skype to the 800 number to activate it.</p>
<p>3. Introduce</p>
<p>Windows 8 have two desktop system :  oriental desktop and Metro. the software have two different running mode. In Metro mode, the windows like the system of cellphone. All the software install in the app store. using the alt+f4 and drog it to bottom to close it. and it can use windows button to back to metro and desktop. using left bar to switch every software, right bar to search, share and configure and bottom bar to more control.</p>
<p>the useful metro software:</p>
<p>a. mail, calender and  message</p>
<p>b.  chrome for metro</p>
<p>c. youdao dictionary.</p>
<p>d. wenbo, renren, qqmusic, the qq for metro will come soon.</p>
<p>e. sougou input(metro mode): chrome need google input tools to input chineses.</p>
<p>4. development</p>
<p>using vs2012 to develop metro style software, but at frist, you must be get the development licence from vs2012.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">The first metro application(switch proxy)</span></p>
